### Welcome to my GitHub 🌌  

🌹 **About Me:**  
I’m Yaroslav Yekasov, a third-year IT student at Tallinna Tööstushariduskeskus 🎓, driven by an insatiable curiosity for coding and creating. My passion lies in weaving logic into solutions that feel almost poetic.  

📌 **What I’m Working On:**  
Currently immersed in projects that span **C#**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. Whether it’s sculpting the elegance of a backend service or breathing life into web interfaces, I revel in the art of programming.  

📌 **Learning Goals:**  
Honing my craft in **Linux**, **Nginx**, **Svelte**, and **Sapper**. I crave the depth of understanding that turns tools into a symphony of productivity.  

📌 **Looking to Collaborate:**  
Have an idea that’s as bold as it is beautiful? I’m all for teaming up to create something extraordinary, something that lingers.  

📌 **Fact:**  
When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me in [Baldur's Gate 3](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199246008866).
